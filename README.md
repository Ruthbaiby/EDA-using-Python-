# EDA-using-Python-
Exploratory Data Analysis using Seaborn
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics.
It is used to understand data, get some context regarding it, understand the variables and the relationships between them, and formulate hypotheses that could be useful when building predictive models.

All data analysis must be guided by some key questions or objectives. Before starting any data analysis tasks, you should have a clear goal in mind. When your goal allows you to understand your data and the problem, you will be in a good position to get meaningful results out of your analysis!

In this tutorial, we will learn how to perform EDA using data visualization. Specifically, we will focus on seaborn, a Python library that is built on top of matplotlib and has support for NumPy and pandas.

seaborn allows us to make attractive and informative statistical graphics. Although matplotlib makes it possible to visualize essentially anything, it is often difficult and tedious to make the plots visually attractive. seaborn is often used to make default matplotlib plots look nicer, and also introduces some additional plot types.
